Internship Project Plan: Smart Home Automation Using IoT and Digital Logic
📌 Project Title:
Smart Energy-Efficient Home Automation System Using Digital Logic and IoT

📋 Project Abstract:
This project aims to develop a low-power, intelligent home automation system by combining traditional digital logic circuits with a microcontroller-based IoT platform. It enables real-time remote monitoring and control of home appliances such as lights and fans using both automated and manual inputs. The use of digital logic gates offloads simple decisions from the microcontroller, improving power efficiency and response time.

🛠️ Project Modules:
1. Digital Logic Control Unit
Logic gates used to:

Turn on lights only when motion is detected AND it’s dark.

Turn on fan when motion is detected AND temperature > 30°C.

Implemented using 74-series ICs.

2. Microcontroller (ESP32/ESP8266)
Reads sensor inputs.

Sends control signals to relays or actuators.

Connects to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for remote control.

Uploads data to IoT cloud (ThingSpeak, Firebase, Blynk).

3. Sensors and Actuators
Sensors: PIR (motion), DHT11 (temperature), LDR (light).

Actuators: Lights, fan (controlled via relays).

4. Remote Monitoring and Control
Wi-Fi: Web dashboard / Blynk App for real-time status and control.

Bluetooth (optional): Control through smartphone app.

5. Power Optimization Techniques
ESP32 deep sleep mode when inactive.

Power down sensors when not needed.

Low-power logic design to reduce static power consumption.
